        <h3>What's at Stake?</h3>
        <p>
          The department serves on average 150,000 students and educators
          providing before & after school care, extracurricular activities, and
          school-based therapy services. Further, HCDE runs four schools
          dedicated to educating, supporting and encouraging our youth that are
          adjudicated or expelled, in substance abuse recovery and those with
          intellectual and behavioral disabilities. All these services are
          provided by leveraging the Harris County tax dollar, costing each
          household an average of 9 dollars per year and saving partners and
          school districts millions of dollars through shared services. Further,
          the department has lowered the tax rate each year since 2015.
          <br />
          <br />
          HCDE is unique from independent school boards in that it can be
          eliminated via a bill in congress. It is imperative to maintain a
          board of directors that believes in the mission to continue serving
          the citizens of Harris County. In the past, sitting board members have
          advocated to close the department.
          <br />
          <br />I am proud of the Harris County Department of Education. As your
          Precinct 2 Trustee, I will continue to support the mission and vision
          of HCDE because I believe in the work we are doing and the difference
          it makes in the lives of Harris County citizens.
